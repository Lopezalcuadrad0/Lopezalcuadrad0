📌 More about me:

My cat's name is Piti De Liar and she is adorable! 😻
I don't like combing my hair, so I usually go around with messy hair. 😂
I love retro football shirts, but I also like dressing up. Perfect balance, as all things should be. 😉
I enjoy reading. My favorite book is "The Baron in the Trees" by Italo Calvino.
